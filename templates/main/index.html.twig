        <h2>Welcome on MyRig! (Beta. Half of the functions will come later ... maybe)</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>MyRig</strong>, the ultimate online community where musicians, gear enthusiasts,
            and creators come together to share their passion for instruments and gear. Whether you're a professional

            of your unique musical journey.
        </p>

        <h2>What is MyRig?</h2>

            MyRig is more than just a platform; it's a vibrant community dedicated to celebrating the art of music and
            the tools that bring it to life. Here, users can:

        </p>

        <h2>Why Share Your Rig?</h2>
        <p>
            Every instrument, amp, pedal, or piece of studio gear has a story. Maybe it’s the guitar you saved up for years to buy,
            the amp that powered your first gig, or the keyboard you inherited from a mentor. Sharing your rig is not just about
            showing off your equipment—it’s about sharing your journey, your inspirations, and your evolution as a musician.
        </p>
        <p>
            By sharing your rig, you’re also contributing to a growing knowledge base. The details you provide might inspire someone
            else to discover a new sound or help them solve a technical challenge. It's a two-way street of inspiration and support
            that makes this community so unique.
